            <p>
                Over the course of my internships, I have developed expertise in applying data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems. 
                In my first internship, I worked on data management projects where I implemented solutions for data collection and analytics using APIs and enhanced a client-server applications by adding new features matching the dynamic project requirements.

                During my most recent internship, I focused on designing and implementing automated data pipelines to aggregate IoT data into a time-series database for real-time network monitoring. 
                I applied data science techniques to analyze network metrics, identify trends, and detect anomalies, contributing to the development of a diagnostic tool for fault detection and network performance optimization.
